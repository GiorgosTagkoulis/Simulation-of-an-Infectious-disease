# Simulation of an Infectious disease

In health care, many times it is critical to make important decisions to prevent the spread of a multi-resistant bacteria, or to facilitate a vaccination program for influenza. These decisions are
based heavily on models which predict how a particular disease, if we have certain statistical data, could develop or not into an epidemic. Therefore, since these models could have a huge impact
on the society, economy and individuals, it is crucial to generate correct results when it is fed with accurate assumptions of how an infectious disease could be spread out.

This model reflects on how a contagious disease is spread in a society given the probability of infection. With this probability, it can then be determined if the disease will be developed develop into an epidemic or not.
